You will be met and transferred to your houseboat in Srinagar. When we think of Kashmir, the first thing that comes to our Mind is 'Houseboats'. Staying on a Houseboat means like living in Paradise, an experience one is not likely to find anywhere else on the surface of the earth. In the evening, enjoy a romantic Shikara ride for one hour on the Dal lake. Overnight in Houseboat.</p>
